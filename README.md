# student-notes
A place for Unloop students to practice version control, and check-in their notes on lectures, bootcamps, podcasts, etc.

Notes:

1. Fork this repository, and then clone your fork into VS-Code using the `git clone <link>` command.
    1.5 Hint: The big, green button has the link you are looking for 
2. cd into the repository
2.5 Create your own folder, where you will be creating your files and committing/pushing them.
    Command: `mkdir <yourname>`
3. Create & checkout into a new branch in git 
    `git checkout -b typing/<yourname>`
    
4. Split your screen side-by-side for convenience while taking notes - have the video/podcast/article on the right side, and VS Code on the left side.
5. For each new podcast, or lecture, or video module, create a new file and commit/push your notes up here.

6. `Ctrl ~` to open the terminal (two tries potentially)
  - Make sure you are using Control, and not Command + Tilda (if on a Mac)
  - Make sure that your mouse has clicked into VS Code, and that is the program that your keyboard is focusing on. 
  
7. touch `html-lecture.md`

8. Send a pull-request to the master branch for the central repository of `unloop:student-notes` you forked (in other words, the original).
